Attention: The below solution does not take advantage the use of hash maps in O(1) 
because we made a nasty mistake, used hash_map.values() but this is O(n).
Instead we use hash_map storing the values as keys.
Be aware that even the dict.keys() is O(n) it generates a list and then iterates over it.
