# Find a pair in a given list which has sum equals to targetSum, assume there is at most one pair.


##### Solution 1: 

array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10
hash_map = {}

# we solve y + x = targetSum => y = targetSum - x, so if we assume that y exists in the hash maps,  
# previously we store the array as keys of a new hash_map (distionary),
# then we are sure that x + y = targetSum
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
	for x in array:
		y = targetSum - x
		if y in hash_map:
			return [x, y] 
		else:
            hash_map[x] = 'T'
	return []


print(twoNumberSum(array, targetSum))

# (O(n) from the list traverse "for x in array:" + O(1) from "if y in hash_map:"
# T(n) = O(n) + O(1) = O(n)  
# Space = O(2n)


##### Solution 2:

array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10

# sort the array so: [-4, -1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11], set two pointers one the the legt one to the right
# pointers act as the lower and uper bound and if x+y < or targetSum we limit the bounds for searching 
# because the array is already sorted so we converge the summation to the targetSum.  
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
    array.sort()
    left_pos = 0
    right_pos = len(array) - 1
    while left_pos <= right_pos:
        if array[left_pos] + array[right_pos] < targetSum:
            left_pos += 1
        elif array[left_pos] + array[right_pos] > targetSum:
            right_pos -= 1
        else:
            return [array[left_pos], array[right_pos]]
	return []

print(twoNumberSum(array, targetSum))

# T(n) = O(nlong) from sorting
#         + O(n) from while loop in worst case, where n = array length

Attention: The below solution does not take advantage the use of hash maps in O(1) like the Solution 1
because we made a nasty mistake, used hash_map.values() but this is O(n).
Instead we use hash_map storing the values as keys.
Be aware that even the dict.keys() is O(n) it generates a list and then iterates over it.
