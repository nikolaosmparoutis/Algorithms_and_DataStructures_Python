<Deploy code to Google Cloud Platform Instance>

First create an isolated virtual environment. 
This ensures that our app does not interfere with other Python applications 
that may be available on our system.

    virtualenv --python python3 ~/envs/<new_X_directory>

Activate your newly created virtual environment:

    source ~/envs/<new_X_directory>/bin/activate

Upload the file through the terminal 

Find where is the uploaded .py file

    find . -name "<filename*>"

Create the directory:

    mkdir <directory_name> 

Rename the directory if you need a better name:

    find . -depth -type d -name <source_directory> -execdir mv {} <target_directory> \;

Move every .py files from the uploading location to the new directory

    mv *.py <destination_directory>

Execute the python file:

    python <file>
